# Philosophers
Apparently serving and eating spaghetti with a single fork is very inconvenient, so the philosophers will eat with two forks.<br />

# Dining philosophers problem
The dining philosopher's problem is the classical problem of synchronization which says that Five philosophers are sitting around a circular table and their job is to think and eat alternatively. A bowl of noodles is placed at the center of the table along with five chopsticks for each of the philosophers - copy & paste from internet.
